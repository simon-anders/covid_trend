<p>Increase of the number of Covid19 cases over the last few weeks:</p>

<p>This chart helps you understand you how dramatic exponential growth can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>The diagonal gray lines indicate exponential growth with a <strong>10-fold increase every week</strong>.</li>
<li>Observe that the gray lines match quite closely the trend for many countries.</li>
<li><p>Use the gray lines as guide to look ahead for a few days: Where is your country heading? When will it be where Italy is now?</p></li>
<li><p>Move your mouse over the coloured lines to read of indidual values.</p></li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>How worried should we be? Here is my very personal opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It's the older, the sick, weak or frail people who are at serious risk of dying. So, if you are, like me, healthy and not old, you might not worry too much <strong>about youself</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember, <strong>however:</strong> If you get infected, you will be contagious days before you notice. In that time you might infect others, and they might get much more seriously ill than you.</p></li>
<li><p>And if we cannot slow down this exponential growth, hospitals will be overwhelmed and will not manage to treat those who get really sick. They will die. In Italy, this is already happing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So: We need to take this pandemic serious, if not for our own sake, then for sake of the those weaker than us. This is not the time to be selfish.</p>
<p>Technical notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data is taken from the time series of confirmed cases at <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series">this page</a>. This data is collected by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (<a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/">JHU CSSE</a>), who collect data from <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">various sources</a> and update their table daily. They also offer <a href="https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/">their own information &quot;dashboard&quot;</a>.</li>
<li>To reduce clutter, only countries with more than 300 cases are shown, and only from 17 Feb on. JHU CSSE has more complete information.</li>
